#  Contributing
The 
preferred 
way 
to   contribute 
to EvenVizion 
is   to fork
 the 
main 
repository 
on GitHub, 
then
 submit 
a “pull 
request” (PR)
 - as   done 
for 
scikit-learn 
contributions:
-  Fork 
the 
project 
repository: 
click 
on the
 ‘Fork’ 
button near
 the 
top of 
the 
page. 
This 
creates
 a  copy
 of   the 
code 
under 
your 
account 
on the 
GitHub 
user 
account.
-  Clone 
your 
fork 
of the 
scitime 
repo 
from 
your 
GitHub 
account 
to your 
local 
disk:
```$ 
git clone 
git@github.com:YourLogin/evenvizion.git
$  cd   EvenVizion
#  Install 
library 
in   editable 
mode:
$  pip install
 --editable 
.
```
-  Create 
a  branch 
to hold 
your
 development 
changes:
```
$  git checkout
 -b   my-feature
```
and 
start 
making
 changes. 
Always 
use 
a feature 
branch. 
It’s 
good 
practice 
to 
never
 work 
on the 
masterbranch!
-  Develop
 the 
feature 
on   your 
feature 
branch 
on your 
computer,
 using 
Git 
to 
do the 
version 
control. 
When 
you’re 
done
 editing,
 add changed 
files 
using 
git 
add and 
then 
git 
commit 
files:
```
$  git add 
modified_files
$  git commit
```
-  to record 
your
 changes 
in   Git, 
then 
push 
the changes 
to your
 GitHub 
account 
with:
```
$  git push
 -u origin 
my-feature
```
-  Follow 
GitHub 
instructions 
to   create 
a  pull
 request 
from 
your
 fork.
Some 
quick 
additional 
notes:
-  We try 
to   follow 
the 
PEP8
 guidelines 
(using
 flake8, 
ignoring 
codes 
E501 
and 
F401).
